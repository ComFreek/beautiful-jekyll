**Definition:** A CPO is a triple \( X, \leq, \bot \) for a set \( X \) and a partial order \( \leq \) with a least element \( \bot \).

{: .box-note}
**Theorem (Kleene):** If \( f: X \to X \) is a Scott-continuous endofunction on a CPO, it has a smallest fixpoint, which we denote by $$\mu f := \prod_{n=0}^\infty f^n(\bot).$$
